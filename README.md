Project Introduction: 
  The goal of this project is to analyze a dataset containing information about patients with diabetes. The 
dataset comprises demographic information on individuals diagnosed with diabetes, encompassing age, 
ethnicity, and gender, among other variables. Furthermore, the collection includes the patient encounter 
and patient number, which function to anonymously differentiate everyone. The dataset includes 
information regarding admission type, duration of hospitalization, changes in diabetes status, medication 
dispensation, and readmission to the medical facility. By examining various demographic and clinical 
variables, we aim to gain insights into the characteristics of diabetic patients and their interactions with 
healthcare systems. Our research's objective is to examine a dataset comprising significant information 
about individuals diagnosed with diabetes. Our focus is analyzing demographic characteristics, clinical 
variables, and readmission rates. Our principal goals are to optimize resource allocation, enhance patient 
care, and advocate for evidence-based decision making. 


Primary Objectives: 
  The primary objective is to identify the characteristics that influence early patient readmission within 30 
days (about 4 and a half weeks) of being discharged. Our objective is to gather valuable information that 
may be used to develop strategies for enhancing outcomes for patients and efficiently distributing 
healthcare resources. The items listed below are considered the primary objectives of our project. 

• Time spent in hospital 

• Gender and age proportion 

• Demographic Prevalence 

• Hospitalization Frequence by demographics 

• Hospital Stay Duration 

• Medication Usage and Racial Groups 

• Readmission Rates 

• Gender-Specific Hospital Stay 

• Readmission Rates by Demographics

Overview of Dataset 

  This dataset called "Diabetes” holds information on patients diagnosed with diabetes. Information 
included is demographic details like race and gender, along with age categories. Other provided 
information are hospital admission specifications, plus admission type and duration of hospital stay for 
each patient. In addition, medication data indicates any change in medication or if diabetes medication 
was prescribed to patient. This dataset also includes information of the readmission status of patients. 
The dataset facilitates comprehensive insights into diverse aspects within diabetes care and 
management. By analyzing its variables, healthcare practitioners and researchers acquire insights into 
effectives of diabetes treatments, detect patterns, enhance patient care and contributing to lower diabetes 
rates. 
Variables:

• Encounter_id: A unique identifier for patient encounters.  

• Patient_nbr: A unique identifier for patients, allowing for tracking across multiple encounters. 

• Race: The categorization of patient’s racial gender, which includes African American, Asian, Caucasian, Hispanic, and other 

• Gender: The classification of patient gender, distinguishing between Female and Male. 

• Age: This indicates the age range of the patient.  

• Admission_type_id: This is the classification of admission types; Emergency, Urgent, Elective, Newborn, Not Available, NULL, Trauma Center, and Not Mapped 

• Time_in_hospital: This shows the duration of each patient hospital stay during each encounter. 

• Change: Indicated whether there was a change in the patient diabetes medication during encounter  

• DiabetesMed: States if the patient was prescribed to diabetes medication  

• Readmitted: Specify if the patient was readmitted to patient
